Study/Project Name: Evaluation of Lifelong ART and Early Infant HIV Testing in Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV in Kenya

Study/Project Description: 
To reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV, Kenya must continue to improve uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and viral suppression among HIV-infected women during pregnancy and the postpartum period. 
The goal of this project is to evaluate the national prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) program. 
Strategic surveillance can track and improve relevant PMTCT parameters important to the Ministry of Health by identifying cofactors and barriers to success. 
This evaluation included: 1) a survey of mother-infant pairs in a subset of facilities and households,
2) maternal and infant medical record abstraction of those enrolled in PMTCT programs at select facilities,and 
3) a facility-level key informant survey at select facilities. 
Data from this evaluation will determine prevalence and cofactors of antenatal HIV testing, partner HIV disclosure, 6-month exclusive breastfeeding, 
uptake of lifelong ART, viral load testing, virologic failure, retention in PMTCT programs, and infant HIV infection. 
Additionally, we will determine HIV incidence during pregnancy and the postpartum period and characterize PMTCT services at select facilities. 
Data will identify gaps to improve maternal ART uptake and strengthen retention of HIV-exposed infants in early infant HIV diagnosis programs.
